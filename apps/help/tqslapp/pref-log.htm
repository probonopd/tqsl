<H3>Setting TQSL Log Handling Options</H3>
<P>
To inspect or change TQSL's log handlling options, select the <B>File</B> menu's <B>Display or Modify Preferences...</B> command (on <b>OS X</b>, select the <b>Application</b> menu's <b>Preferences</b> command) to display its <B>Preferences</B> dialog; this dialog's <B>Log Handling</B> tab provides control over several settings that govern TQSL's log signing operations:
<UL>
<LI><a href="pref-log.htm#extensions">Specify ADIF and Cabrillo File Extensions</a></li>
<LI><a href="pref-log.htm#nonamateur">Allow Nonamateur Callsigns</a></li>
<LI><a href="pref-log.htm#daterange">Prompt for QSO Date Range</a></li>
<LI><a href="pref-log.htm#dupdetails">Display details of already uploaded QSOs when signing a log</a></li>
<LI><a href="pref-log.htm#qthops">Specify how to handle QTH details in ADIF logs</a></li>
</UL>

<P>
<a name="extensions"></a>
<H5>Specify ADIF and Cabrillo File Extensions</H5>
Because there are no standard file extensions (.XXX) consistently used
for ADIF AND Cabrillo files, TQSL lets you specify the extensions used on your system for each
file types. The <a href="signupload.htm">Select File to Sign and Upload</a> and
<a href="signupload.htm">Select File to Sign and Save</a> dialogs set their <b>Files of type</b>
selectors based on the extensions specified on this tab:

<P>
In the example shown above, files whose names end in <code>.log</code> or <code>.cab</code>
will be treated as Cabrillo files, while those with names ending in <code>.adi</code> or
<code>.ADI</code> are ADIF files. When using an operating system like <b>Windows</b> that doesn't distinguish
case in file names, the two ADIF entries shown in this example would be unneccessary.
<P>
<a name="nonamateur"></a>
<H5>Allow Nonamateur Callsigns</H5>
The <B>Allow nonamateur call signs</b> checkbox lets you to choose whether TQSL
should treat a nonamateur call-worked as an error. An amateur callsign must meet these requirements:
<UL>
<LI>contains only the letters A through Z, the digits 0 through 9, and the slash character</LI>
<LI>contains at least one number and one letter</LI>
<LI>is at least three characters in length</LI>
<LI>does not begin or end with a slash character</LI>
<LI>does not begin with 0</LI>
<LI>does not begin with 1 unless it begins with 1A, 1M, or 1S</LI>
</UL>
<P>LoTW will not accept a QSO whose callsign does not conform to the above requirements so you should leave TQSL's <b>Allow nonamateur call signs</b> box unchecked.</P>
<P>
<a name="daterange"></a>
<H5>Prompt for QSO Date Range</H5>
This checkbox determines whether <b>TQSL</b> will display the <A HREF="daterng.htm"> QSO Date Range dialog</a>
when <a href="signupload.htm">Submitting a Log File to LoTW via the Internet</a> or when
<a href="signupload.htm">Submitting a Log File from a Computer without Internet Access</a>. 
<p>
The <b>QSO Date Range</b> dialog can be used to prevent QSOs already submitted to LoTW that haven't been subsequently modified from being submitted again,
sparing LoTW from processing QSOs that have already been processed. 
<P>
<a name="dupdetails"></a>
<H5>Display details of already uploaded QSOs when signing a log</H5>
If, when <a href="signupload.htm">signing and uploading a file</a> or <a href="signupload.htm">signing and saving a file</a>, TQSL encounters QSOs that have already been submitted to LoTW, then if this box is checked the details of each <i>already uploaded</i> QSO will be reported in the <b>Status Log</b>; if this box is not checked, no details will be reported.
<p>

<a name="qthops"></a>
<H5>Set options for handling QTH details in ADIF logs</H5>
If, when <a href="signupload.htm">signing and uploading a file</a> or <a href="signupload.htm">signing and saving a file</a>, TQSL encounters station information in the log that indicates callsign, DXCC entity, or QTH information such as gridsquare, zone, state, etc. TQSL can verify this against the <A HREF="stnloc.htm">Station Location</a> and either report on or update the <A HREF="stnloc.htm">Station Location</a> with the information from the log. This set of options allows either ignoring, reporting on, or updating the <A HREF="stnloc.htm">Station Location</a> using the log data.
